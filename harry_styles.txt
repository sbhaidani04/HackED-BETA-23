Don’t know where you’ll land when you fly
It’s not what I wanted
Leave you behind
I just think you’re cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I’m cool, too?
Am I too into you?
I could cook an egg on you
There’s life out there
You’vе got the antidote
I’ll take onе to go-go
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we’ll do this again
Passports in footwells
Kiss her and don’t tells
tea with cyborgs
Riot America, science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
You’re always there
Don’t overthink
you feel a fool
bring sun to the darkest days
You showed me a power
In this world, it’s just us
You know it’s not the same
A real girl isn't perfect 
A perfect girl isn't real
