still believe in magic?
i'd rather be in a coma than a fullstop
lights will guide you home
look at the stars
look how they shine for you
the truth is that i miss you
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
forget the world and its weight
all i know is that i love you
for some reason i can't explain
Tears stream down your face when you lose something you cannot replace
if you never try then you'll never know
Every step that you take could be your biggest mistake
In a sky full of stars I think I saw you
it's us against the world
You are the one that I wanted to find
When you try your best but you don't succed
When you get what you want but not what you need
Once upon a time we fell apart
I wrote a song for you
if you love someone you should let them know
You know you make my world light up
Tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
Start as you need to go on
One day the sun will come out
